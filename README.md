# Python Resources

The main aim of this repository is to make Python education free and accessible to all without much hustle. All the resources that are selected are there because of the personal experience of the members of Crework with those free resources. 

Given below are the links for some of the resources where you can learn Python for free. If you want to add any resource, feel free to make changes, I will accept them. 

### Python Programming for beginners

If you are not a video person and want to learn the syntax fast, you should visit [W3Schools Python Tutorial.](https://www.w3schools.com/python/)

The videos mentioned below are taught by MIT professors and are basically two different versions of the same course. The second one is classroom lecture, if you enjoy them more, go with the second link.

[Introduction to Python Programming by MIT](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRJdqdXieSHN0U9AdnmwD-9QcR9hmw04d)

[Introduction to Computer Science with Python by MIT (Class Lecture Videos)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP63WbdFxL8giv4yhgdMGaZNA)

If you want to study in Hindi, you can refer to the following playlist:

#### If you want to do some projects in python to get more hands on experience, you can refer to this video:

[12 Beginner Projects in Python](https://youtu.be/8ext9G7xspg)

### Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

The playlists mentioned below can give you a good introduction to Data Structures and how to implement each of them using python:

[Algorithms and Data Structures (freecodecamp)](https://youtu.be/8hly31xKli0)

[Data Structures and Algorithms in Python](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeo1K3hjS3uu_n_a__MI_KktGTLYopZ12)

If you want to learn about Algorithms in detail, refer to this playlist by MIT:

[Algorithms by MIT](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61Oq3tWYp6V_F-5jb5L2iHb)

One of my favourite resources for learning DSA is GeeksforGeeks.

[Data Structures by GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/)

[Algorithms by GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fundamentals-of-algorithms/?ref=shm)

### Object Oriented Programming in Python

For basic understanding you can refer [W3Schools OOPs in Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_classes.asp)

Then you can go through this playlist by Corey Schafer for better understanding of the concepts:

### What Next?

You can do a lot if you know python, you can start with development, Machine Learning or Analytics. Below are the links to few resources which you might want to explore:
